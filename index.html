          Thank you for coming here. It means a lot that you came. We know that your feelings about this are very serious and real, and that you are coming from a place of deep care for women and children. We understand that for you this is a calling from God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve listened and read a lot, and we hear what you have to say. We don’t want to yell or argue. Instead we wanted to share this way, calmly, and ask you to please try to hear us out until the end. We don’t claim to speak for all of us in our situation, but we speak for many, and we seek compassion and empathy for all.

          <span class='intro-question'>Did you know?</span> The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any other developed nation — 3 to 7 times that of countries like Finland, France, Sweden, Portugal, and the U.K. — and we are the only developed nation where that rate is on the rise.<sup>10</sup> A disproportionate lack of research, funding and training nationally on maternal issues<sup>9</sup> suggests a systemic bias. The illegality of abortion in the United States was rather short lived, beginning in the mid-1800s and ending with Roe v. Wade in 1973. The ongoing denouncement in the Catholic Church also began relatively recently, in the mid-1800s <em>(though the Pope's recent admissions of obtaining abortions for nuns raped by priests might put the validity of this position into question)</em>.<sup>39</sup> Prior to that, abortion has a long documented history extending over 4000 years.<sup>1</sup> Termination of pregnancy is considered a human right by the United Nations, and lack of access to it is considered to be torture in cases of rape, incest, and risk of death for the mother.<sup>25</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='intro-question'>What makes fewer abortions?</span> It’s not exposure to the church; 62% of people who have abortions nationally are religious, 54% are either Protestant, evangelical Protestant, or Catholic,<sup>5</sup> and some even picket clinics themselves.<sup>35</sup> It’s not laws; internationally, rates of abortion are near equal in countries with the most extreme restrictions and in those with the most lenient, even negligibly higher in the former.<sup>24</sup> It’s not shaming, stigma, threat of jail, or illness or death resulting from unsafe procedures.<sup>29</sup> What does reduce abortion? Sexual education and access to contraception is proven to lower rates.<sup>20,33</sup> One example, a program in Colorado that gave out free IUDs to women that wanted them, turned around a 35% drop in abortion rate and saved the public $80M in Medicaid costs, but the program was cut by Republican lawmakers due to pressure from Christian groups.<sup>34</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class='intro-question'>In countries and states where the practice is banned or prevented, what happens?</span> Maternal mortality and incarceration rates increase. Maternal mortality is 8-11% higher<sup>22,23</sup> in states with extreme abortion restrictions like Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas,<sup>22</sup> and in countries with the most extremely restrictive policies, including Iraq, Honduras, and El Slavador <em>(With our country's long history with Afghanistan, and talking points surrounding its attitudes towards women, I feel the need to mention that the practice is even allowed there, at least to save a woman's life).</em><sup>7</sup> Some possible reasons for increased maternal mortality include complications from unsafe abortions, suicide, and doctor refusal to prescribe lifesaving medicine or surgery in case of risk to the fetus, such as in ectopic pregnancy.<sup>6</sup> More women are in jail in these states and countries, for abortion, but also for natural miscarriage wrongfully charged as abortion.<sup>23</sup>

          <span class='intro-question'>How do you show support for our children?</span> Three out of four of people seeking an abortion are at or below the poverty line<sup>5</sup> and make this difficult choice because they cannot financially afford a child or more children.<sup>13</sup> On average, one in five children live in poverty nationally, and in states with the most extreme abortion restrictions, the child-poverty rate can be as high as 28%.<sup>38</sup> Republicans have a long history of cutting social welfare programs,<sup>36</sup> and fighting hard against a raised minimum wage.<sup>37</sup> The President's proposed 2020 budget includes devastating cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other programs that help low-income children and their families get by. Families are struggling, and aid is scarce. Do you actively help support social programs that help children and their families to live?

              I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, a child educated, a child housed. And why would I think that you don't? Because you don't want any tax money to go there. That's not pro-life. That's pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is.
